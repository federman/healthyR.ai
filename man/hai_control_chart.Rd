hai_control_chart(
  .data,
  .value_col,
  .x_col,
  .center_line = mean,
  .std_dev = 3,
  .plt_title = NULL,
  .plt_catpion = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{data frame or a path to a csv file that will be read in}

\item{.value_col}{variable of interest mapped to y-axis (quoted, ie as a string)}

\item{.x_col}{variable to go on the x-axis, often a time variable. If unspecified
row indices will be used (quoted)}

\item{.center_line}{Function used to calculate central tendency. Defaults to
mean}

\item{.std_dev}{Number of standard deviations above and below the central
tendency to call a point influenced by "special cause variation." Defaults
to 3}

\item{.plt_title}{Plot title}

\item{.plt_catpion}{Plot caption}

\item{.plt_font_size}{Font size; text elements will be scaled to this}

\item{.print_plot}{Print the plot? Default = TRUE. Set to FALSE if you want to
assign the plot to a variable for further modification, as in the last
example.}

\value{
Generally called for the side effect of printing the control chart.
Invisibly, returns a ggplot object for further customization.

\description{
Create a control chart, aka Shewhart chart:

\details{
Control charts, also known as Shewhart charts (after Walter A. Shewhart) or
process-behavior charts, are a statistical process control tool used to determine
if a manufacturing or business process is in a state of control. It is more
appropriate to say that the control charts are the graphical device for
Statistical Process Monitoring (SPM). Traditional control charts are mostly
designed to monitor process parameters when underlying form of the process
distributions are known. However, more advanced techniques are available in
the 21st century where incoming data streaming can-be monitored even without
any knowledge of the underlying process distributions. Distribution-free
control charts are becoming increasingly popular.

\examples{
data_tbl <- tibble::tibble(
    day = sample(c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"),
                 100, TRUE),
    person = sample(c("Tom", "Jane", "Alex"), 100, TRUE),
    count = rbinom(100, 20, ifelse(day == "Friday", .5, .2)),
    date = Sys.Date() - sample.int(100))

hai_control_chart(.data = data_tbl, .value_col = count, .x_col = date)

# In addition to printing or writing the plot to file, hai_control_chart
# returns the plot as a ggplot2 object, which you can then further customize

library(ggplot2)
my_chart <- hai_control_chart(data_tbl, count, date)
my_chart +
  ylab("Number of Adverse Events") +
  scale_x_date(name = "Week of ... ", date_breaks = "week") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
